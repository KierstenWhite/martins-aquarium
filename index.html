      <h3>Keeping the Fishies Safe</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of ways we need to keep the fishies safe. They should be salted and heated to 180 degrees in the oven. Crispy skin is the best to protect them from sharks. When scubaing to harvest the fish, don't worry about using a tank. It will wear you down. Lastly, dangerous fish are actually just trying to say hello. So, pet them if you can.</p>
